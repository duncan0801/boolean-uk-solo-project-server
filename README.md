# Project Summary 
Here we have a game lobby where a user can sign up/ log in and view the lobbies that they are a part of. A user can create their own lobby and invite people with the lobby id, or join another lobby with a lobby id. This project currently has no gmes. However, it is a working progress that will allow me to create more projects (such as a multiplayer game of checkers)  within the app for players to play together in their lobbies.
